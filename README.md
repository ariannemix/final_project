**Competencies Assessment Program, Final Project**

 This program stores user and competency assessment data for a fake company. Managers can edit, view, delete, and otherwise navigate the database, while regular users are only allowed access to their own account information.
 
 In order to access the full scope of the program, users will need manager access. You can get this using Cami Cardosa's account (Email: ccdosa@hotmail.com, Password: password!). For user access, use Claire Jones account (Email: cjonesy@gmail.com, Password: ihw55jjj)
 
 Run main.py to begin.
